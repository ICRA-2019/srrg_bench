#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Steffen Urban has an alternative [[https://github.com/urbste/mdBRIEF][implementation]] of BOLD, with more =openCV= friendly test definitions.

** Compilation 

In order to run the example described in =main.cpp= you need to download the sample datasets from [[http://www.iis.ee.ic.ac.uk/~vbalnt/bold/dataset-ubc-bold.tar.gz][http://www.iis.ee.ic.ac.uk/~vbalnt/bold/dataset-ubc-bold.tar.gz]]
and extract the file inside the main git folder.

To compile the code type 
#+begin_src shell
cmake .
make
#+end_src

and run =./bold= to run a simple patches experiment on the =notredame=
dataset from from the
[[http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mbrown/patchdata/patchdata.html][UBC Patches Dataset]]

The program will run print a series of evaluation results for the patch pairs
from the dataset above eg.

#+begin_src bash
0 296 136
1 125 31
1 237 77
.
.
.
1 147 39
0 292 136
1 125 26
#+end_src

The first column contains the patch pair label (0 negative, 1
positive), the second row contains the unmasked distance between the
two patches of the pair, and the third the masked distance using the
methodology described in our paper. 

Notice that the new masked distance in the case of positive patches is
(in terms of ratio) much smaller than the original compared to the
negative patches. This confirms the findings that the masked distance
is more discriminative.


** Note
Currently the BOLD code works with =32x32= patches. In order to
generalize it, convert the indexes of the patch tests in the
=bold.descr= file.
