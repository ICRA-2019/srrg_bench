NOTE THAT THE PROJECTIONS AND THESHOLDS CAN ONLY BE USED WITH THE SIFTPP IMPLEMENSTION OF A.Vedaldi (http://www.vlfeat.org/~vedaldi/code/siftpp.html) WHICH WE INCLUDE HERE.

This software contains:
1.) the computation of LDAHash (ldahash)
2.) evaluation of LDAHash and SIFT on lidar ground truth data

compiling:
-change the make.inc and or Makefile to fit your computer
-or just type "make"
-two executables are build: sifthash and eval_descriptor

usage:
there is a script (runEvaluation.sh) that computes SIFT and SIFT-Hash, does the evaluation on fountain und herzjesu and makes the ROC and precision/recall plots as eps files.
